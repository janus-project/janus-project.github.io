Janus Project
==============

Janus is an open-source multi-agent platform fully implemented in Java 1.7. 
Janus enables developers to quickly create web, enterprise and desktop multiagent-based applications. 
It provides a comprehensive set of features to develop, run, display and monitor multiagent-based applications. 
Janus-based applications can be distributed across a network. 
Janus could be used as an agent-oriented platform, an organizational platform, and/or an holonic platform. 
It also natively manages the concept of recursive agents and holons.
	
Janus is jointly developed by the multiagent teams of the Laboratoire Systèmes et Transports and the Grupo de Investigación en Tecnologías Informáticas Avanzadas de Tucumán.
	
This is the new version of Janus fully reimplemented to support the SARL Agent-Oriented Programming Language (http://www.sarl.io).
