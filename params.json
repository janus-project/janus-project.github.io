{"name":"Janus-project.github.io","tagline":"Multiagent platform","body":"\r\nJanus Project\r\n==============\r\n\r\nJanus is an open-source multi-agent platform fully implemented in Java 1.7. \r\nJanus enables developers to quickly create web, enterprise and desktop multiagent-based applications. \r\nIt provides a comprehensive set of features to develop, run, display and monitor multiagent-based applications. \r\nJanus-based applications can be distributed across a network. \r\nJanus could be used as an agent-oriented platform, an organizational platform, and/or an holonic platform. \r\nIt also natively manages the concept of recursive agents and holons.\r\n\t\r\nJanus is jointly developed by the multiagent teams of the Laboratoire Systèmes et Transports and the Grupo de Investigación en Tecnologías Informáticas Avanzadas de Tucumán.\r\n\t\r\nThis is the new version of Janus fully reimplemented to support the SARL Agent-Oriented Programming Language (http://www.sarl.io).\r\n\t\r\nContributors\r\n=============\r\nSebastian RODRIGUEZ, Nicolas GAUD, Stéphane GALLAND.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n    Copyright 2014 Sebastian RODRIGUEZ, Nicolas GAUD, Stéphane GALLAND.\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
